# Bus Factor Visualizer
This is the main repository for the ICTL + BILSEN project on bus factor visualization

## Description
This repository holds all the progress and experiments made with React and D3 to build a web application that can interactively illustrate the knowldege distribution and the "bus factor" for software projects

## Structure
This repository is organized into two main folders:
 + react-project: This folder contains the main React project that we will slowly incorporate new features in as we test and experiment with them. The app is based on React and D3.js. More details can be found in the README file in the folder itself.
  
 + experiments: This folder contains the experiments we have performed and will perform with visualization frameworks, especially D3.js.

## How to run
The details on how to build and run the React project and the examples/experiments are found in the READMEs in their respective folders.

## Supporting documents
We keep track of progress and features on a few documents on Google Drive
